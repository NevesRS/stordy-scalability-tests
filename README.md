# stordy-scalability-tests

This repository is part of a master's thesis called "Stordy". "Stordy" is an indexing system developed as a addition/contribution for SpeedyChain project, available at [SpeedyChain GitHub Repository](https://github.com/conseg/speedychain) and [Stordy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/leonardocreatus/stordy).

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of scalability tests for the "stordy" indexing system. These tests aim to evaluate the performance of "stordy" under various load conditions, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

## Running the Tests

To run the scalability tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the "stordy" project is set up and running correctly.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `npm run tests`.
